# Project Brief

## Core Requirements

The website should be a compact and mobile-friendly professional portfolio with a modern and minimalistic design. It should be SEO-optimised and serve as a one-stop guide for recruiters and potential co-founders.

## Goals

The website should showcase my education background, work experience, and skill-sets. It should also serve as a repository of my product thoughts in the form of short Product stories. Recruiters and potential co-founders should be able to contact me directly with the information provided on the website. Peers and collaborators should be able to quickly resonate with the vibe of a professional Product Manager and be able to deep dive into my projects.
