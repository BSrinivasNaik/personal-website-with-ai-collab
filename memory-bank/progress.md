## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   The decision to use React, Tailwind CSS, and MDX was based on the PRD document and the desire to create a modern, minimalistic, and SEO-optimised website.
*   The decision to use a typing animation for the subheadlines was changed to an ease-in-out animation based on the user's feedback.
*   The decision to display the CV in an expanded form was changed to opening it in a new tab based on the user's feedback.

## Success Metrics
