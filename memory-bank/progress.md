## Current Status

The project is in the final stages of development, with core functionality and deployment mechanisms established.

## Known Issues

*   None at this time.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   The decision to use React, Tailwind CSS, and MDX was based on the PRD document and the desire to create a modern, minimalistic, and SEO-optimised website.
*   The decision to use a typing animation for the subheadlines was changed to an ease-in-out animation based on the user's feedback.
*   The decision to display the CV in an expanded form was changed to opening it in a new tab based on the user's feedback.
*   **Deployment Strategy**: Initially attempted GitHub Actions for deployment, but encountered persistent issues with asset pathing and branch synchronization. Transitioned to using the `gh-pages` npm package for more direct control over the deployment process. This involved:
    *   Configuring `vite.config.ts` and `src/App.tsx` to dynamically handle base URLs (`/` for local, `/personal-website-with-ai-collab/` for GitHub Pages) using `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`.
    *   Iteratively fixing asset paths (images, PDFs, favicon) across various components (`HeroSection.tsx`, `ProjectsSection.tsx`, `AboutSection.tsx`) and `index.html` to correctly resolve relative to the dynamic base URL.
    *   Implementing a `public/404.html` for SPA routing fallback on GitHub Pages.
    *   Ensuring the `gh-pages` branch was correctly created and pushed to the remote repository for the `gh-pages` package to function.
    *   Adding a `public/CNAME` file for custom domain integration with GoDaddy.

## Success Metrics

*   Page visits
*   CV downloads
*   Contacts made via website
*   Engagement with Product Stories posts (shares/comments)
